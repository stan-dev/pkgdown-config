If you haven't started a `pkgdown` site yet, initialize it.

```r
usethis::use_pkgdown()
```

In `./_pkgdown.yml` add the contributed package:

```yaml
template:
  package: pkgdownconfig
```

Point to this repository in `DESCRIPTION` to download the theme automatically.

```yaml
Config/Needs/website: stan-dev/pkgdown-config
```

Optionally, you should be able to pin a specific version of the template with a tag or commit:

```yaml
Config/Needs/website: stan-dev/pkgdown-config@v1.0.1

Config/Needs/website: stan-dev/pkgdown-config@COMMITHASH
```

Now you should be good to run `pkgdown::build_site()`!

If for some reason the favicons don't get copied over, download [logo.svg](https://github.com/stan-dev/logos/blob/master/logo.svg), and run `pkgdown::build_favicons()` once to build the favicons. If you already have favicons, the template my overwrite them to save a copy and ping `@Visruth` on the Stan Slack.

Note that the favicons and logo should be copied into your build directory and ideally should be hooked in automatically. If you can't find the logo, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/logos/blob/master/hex_stickers/stan_hex_cut.svg) and follow the same steps above.

If you want the hex in your README, edit the `README.MD`. You can take a look at this package's to get an idea of what you need to do (repeated below):

```md
# pkgdownConfig <a href="https://mc-stan.org/pkgdown-config"><img src="man/figures/logo.svg" align="right" height="139" alt="pkgdownConfig website" /></a>
```

For any further concerns/help/anything, open an issue and/or ping `@Visruth` on the Stan Slack.

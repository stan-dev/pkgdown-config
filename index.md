# Stan pkgdown Configuration

Built in the vein of
[stan-dev/quarto-config](https://github.com/stan-dev/quarto-config).

Styling for Stan sites built with pkgdown. Do not use this theme in a
non-Stan package.

See the [vignettes](https://mc-stan.org/pkgdown-config/articles/) for
setup instructions.

For any further concerns or help, open an issue and/or ping `@Visruth`
